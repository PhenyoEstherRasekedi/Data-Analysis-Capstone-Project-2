##Data driven strategy to increase satisfaction rate at Dano Airlines

###Project Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the latest passenger survey results of Dano Airlines that shows satisfaction rate dipped under 50% for the first time ever. By analysing various aspects of the survey results, I seek to analyze the data to find the key areas for the leadership team to focus on to get back on track.
